Hey Folks!
Welcome to My Power BI Dashboards and Data Projects Repository!

This repository is dedicated to showcasing my Power BI projects, which will include a variety of interactive dashboards, reports, and data visualizations. As I progress through my Power BI courses and apply my skills to real-world datasets, I will regularly update this repository with new projects. My aim is to demonstrate the practical application of Power BI in solving complex business problems, uncovering actionable insights, and presenting data in a meaningful and accessible way.

Power BI is a business intelligent tool developed by Microsoft, which helps users to visualize thier data and share insights across organization. It is a combination of four components namely:
1. Power Query: Power Query is a powerful data connection technology that enables you to discover, connect, combine, and refine data across a wide variety of sources. Think of it as the first step in your data journey. It helps you gather raw data from different places, clean it up, and transform it into a structured format that's ready for analysis. Whether you're pulling in data from Excel files, databases, or web sources, Power Query makes it easy to prepare your data without needing to write any code.

2. Power Pivot: Power Pivot is like a supercharged version of Excel’s regular PivotTables. It allows you to pull in huge amounts of data from various sources, create sophisticated data models, and perform advanced calculations with ease. 

3. Power View: A View in Power BI typically refers to a visualization or a specific way of presenting data on a report or dashboard. It’s like a snapshot that highlights key metrics and information in a user-friendly format. Views can include charts, graphs, maps, and other visual elements that make it easy to understand the data at a glance. By creating different views, you can cater to various audiences and their specific needs, making complex data more accessible and actionable.

4. Power BI Services: BI Services, short for Business Intelligence Services, encompass the tools and platforms provided by Power BI to deliver data insights and analytics to users. These services include the Power BI Desktop for creating reports, the Power BI Service (cloud-based) for sharing and collaborating on those reports, and Power BI Mobile for accessing insights on the go.
